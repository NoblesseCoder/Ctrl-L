# Ctrl-L
## Implementing  the Ctrl+L functionality in Xv6.

To implement Ctrl+L I directly edited the consoleintr function found in console.c file from the Xv6 repository.Here you need to add a new case to handle the Ctrl-L iterrupt.There are already default implementations for some of the cases.The code to do so with comments explaining the steps can be found above.
